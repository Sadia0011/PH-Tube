        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content">

            <ol>
                <li>var:

                <li>Function Scope: Variables declared with var are function-scoped, meaning they are accessible
                    only within the function in which they are declared. If declared outside any function, they
                    become global variables, accessible throughout the entire program.</li>
                <li> Hoisting: Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their containing function or
                    global scope. This means they are moved to the top of their scope during the compilation phase,
                    and you can use them before their actual declaration, although they will be undefined until the
                    declaration is reached.</li>
                </li>
                <li>let:

                <li>Block Scope: Variables declared with let have block scope, meaning they are accessible only
                    within the block (enclosed by curly braces) where they are defined. This includes blocks within
                    functions, loops, conditional statements, and so on.</li>
                <li> No Hoisting: Unlike var, let variables are not hoisted. They are not accessible before their
                    declaration, and trying to use them before declaration results in a ReferenceError.</li>
                </li>
                <li>const:

                <li>Block Scope: Like let, const variables also have block scope. They are limited to the block in
                    which they are defined.</li>
                <li> Constant Values: Variables declared with const are constants, meaning their values cannot be
                    reassigned after declaration. However, for objects and arrays declared with const, while the
                    variable itself is constant, the properties or elements of the object or array can be modified.
                </li>
                </li>

            <p>Undefined means the variable has been declared, but its value has not been assigned. Null means an empty
                value or a blank value. The typeof() operator returns undefined for an undefined variable. The typeof()
                operator returns the type as an object for a variable whose value is assigned as null.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content">
            <p>An API, or application programming interface, is a set of rules that define how applications or devices
                can connect to and communicate with each other. A REST API is an API that conforms to the design
                principles of the REST, or representational state transfer architectural style.</p>
